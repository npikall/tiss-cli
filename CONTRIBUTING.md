### Write Documentation

`tiss-cli` could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at [`github.com/npikall/tiss-cli`][repo].

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `tiss-cli` for local development.

1. Fork the `tiss-cli` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:npikall/tiss-cli.git
   ```
3. Install the dependencies. This project only needs `uv`, install it like so:

   ```sh
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

4. Install Tools. All tools can be installed via PyPI, the most important is the taskrunner `just`.

   ```sh
   uv tool install rust-just
   ```

3. Create a virtualenv. Assuming you have [uv] and [Just] installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development:

   ```sh
   # to setup the virtual environment (or use just venv)
   uv sync

   # to install the pre-commit hooks
   just hooks
   ```

4. Create a branch for local development:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes are formatted correctly and the tests, including testing other Python versions.

   ```sh
   # to lint, format, typecheck and run the tests in python 3.13
   just ci 3.13

   # or to run the tests on different python versions
   just test-all
   ```

   To get the linter, formatter and the typechecker all you need is [uv].

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
   git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.md.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.12 and 3.13. Tests run in GitHub Actions on every pull request to the main branch, make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

## Deploying

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy. Make sure all your changes are committed. Then run:

```sh
just release patch # target can be semver or bump incrementation
git push
git push --tags
```

You can set up a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/building-and-testing/building-and-testing-python#publishing-to-pypi) to automatically deploy your package to PyPI when you push a new tag.
